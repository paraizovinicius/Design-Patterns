# Object-Oriented-Programming

All my personal POO projects here.

# Command Pattern
This project was designed in C#. To run this application, make sure you have .NET compiler installed in your computer https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download
Go to the right directory witch has the main file using 'cd filename' in the terminal
After that, you need to type 'dotnet run' in the terminal.


# Facade Pattern
This project was designed with java language. You need JDK installed. To check if you already have that, run 'java -version'.
After that, install "Java Extension Pack" in VS Code.
To run the main file, type 'java filename' in the terminal.
