# Object-Oriented-Programming

All my personal POO projects here.

Some projects were designed in Java. You need JDK installed. To check if you already have that, run 'java -version'. After that, install "Java Extension Pack" in VS Code. To run the main file, go to the right directory witch has the main file using 'cd filename' in the terminal and type 'java filename' in the terminal.

Some other projects were designed in C#. To run this application, make sure you have .NET compiler installed in your computer https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download. Go to the right directory witch has the main file using 'cd filename' in the terminal. After that, you need to type 'dotnet run' in the terminal.
